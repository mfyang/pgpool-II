 * pgpool-walrecvrunning checks the walreceiver state to it's running.
 * pgpool needs to know if the backend is running as a standby by
 * using pg_is_in_recover(). Problem is, it returns true even if
 * walreceiver is going to shutdown. This function checks the internal
 * variable of walreciver to know if it is going to shutdown.
