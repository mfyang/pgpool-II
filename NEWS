2.3.3 (tomiteboshi) 2010/04/XX

	  * Version 2.3.3

	  This version fixes various bugs since 2.3.2.2.

	  * Incompatible changes

	  - Please note that this version of pgpool consumes more shared
		memory than before. If you encounter problems when starting up
		pgpool, please look into pgpool log. If you find messages
		something like "could not create shared memory segment: Cannot
		allocate memory", please increase the shared memory on your
		system.

	  - Now parallel mode requires replication mode turned
        on. parallel mode without replication mode turned on has been
        broken since pgpool-II was born anyway(Kitagawa)

	  - Change default value for insert_lock to false since there's no
		point in turning this on in master/slave mode. Fix suggested by
		Fujii Masao(Tatsuo)

	  * Newly added documents

	  - README.online-recovery, which is an internal document of
        online recovery, added(Tatsuo)

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix long standing bug since pgpool-II 1.0 which causes
		segfault of pgpool child process.  This was caused by
		miscalculation of shmem size in pgpool parent. Bug analysis by
		Kitagawa patch created by Tatsuo

	  - Add restriction for parallel mode(Kitagawa)
		- The Natural Join is not supported
		- The USING CLAUSE is converted to ON CLAUSE by query rewrite
		  process

	  - Fix possible crash during rewriting JOIN syntax that have
        USING in parallel query mode(Kitagawa)

		This fix is supporting such as following JOIN syntax.

		 example:
		 - SELECT * FROM a JOIN b USING (aid) JOIN c USING (cid);
		 - SELECT * FROM a JOIN b USING (aid) JOIN c USING (cid) JOIN d USING (did)

	  - Fix parallel query so that it can parse INSERT statements that
		have current_time before a partitioning key column(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix SimpleForwardToBackend() so that pgpool doesn't keep
		waiting for reply from a backend, when clients using the
		extended query protocol cause a command error such as bind
		error. This bug occur in master/slave, raw, and connection
		pool mode.  This fix is, sending SYNC message to recover error
		after command error(Kiatagawa)

	  - Fix SIGINT/SIGQUIT is ignored if pgpool child is in
		select(). In this case pgpool retries select() thus the signal
		is ignored(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix connect_inet_domain_socket_by_port/
		connect_unix_domain_socket_by_port so that they check if
		SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGQUIT signal has been delivered.  Per bug
		report from Daniel Codina(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix possible crash during creating "kind mismatch" error
		message. This used to work but was broken in 2.3.2(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug with healh checking. If a network problem such as
		unplugged wire happens while calling connect(), health
		checking does not work since
		connect_unix_domain_socket()/connect_inet_domain_socket() do
		retry if connect() is interrupted by ALARM signal. Added new
		retry argument which controls the retrying behavior to those
		functions.  Per bug report and problem analysis by Daniel
		Codina(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix enbug in 2.3.2.2 with time stamp rewriting in
		SimpleForwardToBackend. Per bug report from Bugtrack #1010771.
		Report from Peter Pramberge(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix rewriting "*" in paralell query.  Patch conributed by
        sho-san(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix connect_inet_domain_socket_by_port() so that it print out
		error message by using hstrerror(), rather than
		strerror()(Tatsuo)

2.3.2.2 (tomiteboshi) 2010/02/22

	  * Version 2.3.2.2

	  This version fixes various bug in 2.3.x.

	  - When rewriting timestamp in extended query, it allocated less
        than what it actually needed. This causes random problematic
        behavior, typically "message: invalid string in message" error
        in backend(Tatsuo).

	  - In extended query, if one of parameters contains NULL, ppool
        crashes(Tatsuo).

	  - If in previous status file all nodes were marked down status,
		it is regarded that this file is bogus. This will prevent "all
		node down" syndrome(Tatsuo).

2.3.2.1 (tomiteboshi) 2010/02/11

	  * Version 2.3.2.1

	  This version fixes bug in 2.3.x. It is identfied that
	  pgpool-II 2.3.x has a problem with erroneous query
	  processing(Akio Ishida).

2.3.2 (tomiteboshi) 2010/02/07

	  * Version 2.3.2

	  This version includes various fixes for bugs in 2.3.1 or before.
	  All 2.3.x users are encouraged to upgrade to 2.3.2 as soon as
	  possible.

	  Also this version enables long awaited SSL support and large
	  object replication support.

	  * Enhancements

	  - SSL support(Sean Finney)

	  - Large object replication support. You need PostgreSQL 8.1 or
        later, however(Tatsuo)

	  - Emit statement log when error or notice message comes from
		query parsing process. This is usefull because PostgreSQL does
		not log particular statement if the error was detected
		*before* raw parser get executed.  This typlically happens
		when encoding error was found(Tatsuo)

	  - Display original query to log if kind mismatch error was
        caused by DEALLOCATE(Tatsuo)

	  - While health checking and recovery use postgres database if
		possible.  If postgres database does not exist, use template1
		as it stands now.  While connecting template1, certain
		commands, for example DROP DATABASE cannot used. Using postgres
		database allows to use these commands while recovery(Tatsuo)

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix errors in timestamp rewriting which occasionaly cause
		broken packet sentto slave nodes(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix errors when timestamp rewriting is used with V2
        protocol(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

	  - Propagate Bind, Describe and Close messages to only master
        node if running in master/slave and in transaction (Tatsuo)

	  - Fix do_child() so that check_stop_request() exits immediately
		when smart shutdown signal has been sent.  This has been used
		to work in 2.2(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

	  - Fix ProcessFrontendResponse not to accept invalid frotend
        packet(Xavier Noguer)

	  - Use %dz for sizeof in fprintf for more portability(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix compiler warnings(Tatsuo)

	  - Do not force replication of DEALLOCATE if operated in
		master/slave mode. Now that pgpool do not execute PARSE in all
		nodes, this was pointless and caused problem (kind mismatch
		when executing DEALLOCATE)(Tatuso)

2.3.1 (tomiteboshi) 2009/12/18

	  * Version 2.3.1

	  This version includes various fixes for bugs in 2.3 or before.
	  All 2.3 users are encouraged to upgrade to 2.3.1 as soon as
	  possible.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - If all of following conditions met, incorrect data is written
        to DB(Tatsuo)

		- pgpool is running in replication mode
		- pgpool is running on 64bit OS
		- INSERT or UPDATE are used which explicitly include now(),
		- CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME. Or the target
		- Table's default value use above functions
	    - The SQL statement inclludes out of 32bit
		  integer value(-2147483648 to 2147483647 in decimal)

		Example SQL: INSERT INTO t1(id, regdate) VALUES(98887776655,
		NOW());

	  - Fix crush in case of more than 18 DB nodes are used(Tatsuo)

	  - Enhance kind mismatch error message. If kind is ERROR or
        NOTICE, the error or notice message from PostgreSQL will be printed(Tatsuo)

2.3 (tomiteboshi) 2009/12/07

	  * Version 2.3

	  This version enhances replication, especially CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	  CURRENT_DATE, now() etc. now can be properly replicated. Also
	  perforance of replication when num_init_children == 1 is
	  enhanced. Pgpool-II now records the status of down nodes, and
	  remember when it restarts to ensure that keep the node status as
	  before. Also some logs are enhanced and more fine fail over
	  controls are added. Please note that pgpool-II 2.3 includes all
	  of enhancements and fixes of pgpool-II 2.2.1 to 2.2.6.

	  * Incompatibilities from 2.2.x

	  - pgpool_status file is created under logdir. So you need to
        give write permission to the directory so that pgpool-II can
        read/write pgpool_status file.

	  * Enhancements

	  - Enable proper replication of results of temporal functions
        (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE, now() etc.). Now
        applications can execute INSERT/UPDATE tables which include
        defaut values using those temporal functions. There are small
        limitations. See restriction sections of docs for more
        details (Akio Ishida)

	  - Use PostgreSQL 8.4's SQL parser(Akio Ishida)

	  - Enhance the performance 20% to 100% of replication when
		num_init_children == 1(Tatsuo)

	  - Add new directive log_per_node_statement which is similar to
        log_statement except that prints info for each DB node to make
        it easier which query is sent to which DB node(Tatsuo)

	  - Add new directive fail_over_on_backend_error to control the
		 behaviro of fail over(Tatsuo)

	  - Record DB node status and remember when pgpool-II restarts(Tatsuo)

	  - EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE for SELECT query are now load
        balanced. This will prevent unwanted kind mismatch errors when
        EXPLAIN produces slightly different plan(Tatsuo)

	  - Enhance CSS of pgpool-ja.html(Tatsuo)

	  - Add sample configuration file for replication mode and
        master/slave mode(Tatsuo)

	 - Add test for temporal data(Akio Ishida)

2.2.6 (urukiboshi) 2009/12/01

	  * Version 2.2.6

	  This version enhances handling of backend weight. Also it allows
	  to use temp tables in master/slave mode. It includes various
	  fixes for bugs in 2.2.5 or before as usual.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Do not allow to load balance DECLARE, CLOSE, FETCH and
        MOVE. If data gets updated and CLOSE issued after transaction
        commit(i.e. holdbale cursor), this will cause data
        inconsistency since CLOSE is executed one of the severs,
        rather than all(Tatsuo)

	  - In master/slave mode, execute Parse message on only master
        node. In previous versions Parse executed on all nodes, which
        grabbed unneccessary lock(Tatsuo)

	  - Remove init script from all runlevels before uninstall(Devrim)

	  - Fix pgpoo.spec(Devrim)

	  - Do not execute REINDEX DATABASE or SYSTEM, CREATE/DROP TABLE
        SPACE inside a transaction block(Tatsuo)

	  * Enhancements

	  - Allow to change weight by reloading pgool.conf. This will take
        effect for next client sessions(Tatsuo)

	  - Reply with usefull error messages, rather than "server closed
        the connection unexpectedly" when authentication fails(Glyn
        Astill)

	  - Add info to logs when writing to sockets falis to know if it
        was for backend or frontend(Tatsuo)

	  - Do not complain when writing to socket of frontend
        fails(Tatsuo)

	  - Allow to use temp tables in master/slave
        mode. INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE will automatically be sent to
        master only. Still SELECT you need to add /*NO LOAD BALANCE*/
        comment(Tatsuo)

	  - Add temp table test to test/jdbc(Tatsuo)

2.2.5 (urukiboshi) 2009/10/4
	  * Version 2.2.5

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.4 or before.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix connection_count_down(). It decrements the connection
        counter too much in some corner cases and causes online
        recover never completes(Tatsuo)

	  - Detect frontend exiting while waiting for commands complete in
        other cases such as internal locks are issued and Parse
        (Tatsuo)

	  - Fix inifinit loop in reset_backend(Xavier Noguer, Tatsuo)

	  - Fix Parse() to print actual query when it detects kind
        mismatch error(Tatsuo)

	  - Document enhancements(Tatsuo)

2.2.4 (urukiboshi) 2009/8/24
	  * Version 2.2.4

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.3 or before.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix possible bug introduced in pgpool-II 2.2.2.  Load balance
		control variables may remain not be restored and subsequent
		DML/DDL call might sent to only master node(Tatsuo)

	  - Send NOTICE message to frontend periodically if V2 protocol is
		used. This is ifdef out since it affectes visible change to
		applications.  2.2.3 unconditionaly sends param packet to
		client even it uses version 2 protocol, which is apparentlt
		wrong. Also tweak checking period from 1 second to 30 seconds
		since 1 second seems too aggressive(Tatsuo)

	  - Block signals before forking children rather after.  Otherwise
		parent will be killed by failover signal if it receives a
		signal before establishing signal handler(Tatsuo)

	  - Remove unnecessary spaces and tabs at the end of line(Jun Kuriyama)

2.2.3 (urukiboshi) 2009/8/11
	  * Version 2.2.3

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.2 or before.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix child process death if one of backends is not available(Tatsuo).

	  - Fix various parallel query bugs(Yoshiharu Mori)

	  - Fix message corruption for kid mismatch error(Akio Ishida)

	  - Now stetmemt_time works(Tatsuo)

	  - Enhance health checking to detect postmaster stopping by
        SIGSTOP(Tatsuo)

	  - Detect frontend abnormal exiting while waiting for reply from
        backend. This only works with V3 protocol(Tatsuo)

	  - Do not start internal transaction if command is CLUSTER
        without arguments(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug with COPY FROM in that backend process remains after
        COPY failed(Tatsuo)

	  * Enhancements

	  - Show last query for extended protocol(Akio Ishida)

	  - Allow to compile sql/pgpool-recovery/pgpool-recovery.c with
        PostgreSQL 8.4(Tatsuo)

2.2.2 (urukiboshi) 2009/5/5
	  * Version 2.2.2

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.1 or before. Please note
	  that an importan fix is made to avoid data incositency risk,
	  which could happen when client does not exit gracely(without
	  sending "X" packet) while pgpool is trying to send data to
	  it. This could happen with all version of pgpool-II.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Ignore write error on frontend connection. This is needed to
		continue processing with backend, otherwise we risk data
		incositency(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug introduced in 2.2.1 (In master slave mode, sometimes
	  	DEALLOCATE fails). If prepared statement reused, pgpool
	  	hangs(Toshihiro)

	  - Fix pgpool crash when SQL command PREPARE and protocol level
        EXECUTE are mixed. The bug was introduced in 2.2(Tatsuo)

	  - Avoid "unexpected EOF on client connection" error in PostgreSQL
        when reset query fails(Tatsuo)
		
2.2.1 (urukiboshi) 2009/4/25
	  * Version 2.2.1

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - In master slave mode, sometimes DEALLOCATE fails. This is
		caused by that the first PREPARE was not executed on the
		slave(Toshihiro)

	  - Update pgpool.spec along with related files(Devrim)

	  - Fix inser_lock so that it is ignored when protocol version is
        2(Tatsuo)
		
	  - Remove excessive log messages regarding parameter change notice(Tatsuo)

	  - Add missing files to doc(Tatsuo)

2.2 (urukiboshi) 2009/2/28
	  * Version 2.2

	  This version enhances SERIAL data type handling and on line
	  recovery. Also an important bug, serializable transactions could
	  cause data inconsistency among DB nodes, is fixed. Query
	  cancelation, which never worked since pgpool-II was born, is
	  finally fixed.

	  * New features/enhancements

		- With insert_lock, now a table is locked only if it has
          SERIAL data type and now the default value for insert_lock
          is true(Tatsuo)

		- Start internal transaction other than INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
          and SELECT to keep node consistency(Tatsuo)

		- Add client_idle_limit_in_recovery directive. This will
		  prevent 2nd stage of on line recovery from not going forward
		  by idle clients sitting forever(Tatsuo)

		- Add pid_file_name directive which specifies a path to the
		  file containing pgpool process id. "logdir" is no more used(Tatsuo)

		- Allow to load balance DECLARE, FETCH and CLOSE(Tatsuo)

		- Add -d option to pcp commands(Jun Kuriyama)

		- Enahnce kind mismatch error message to include originarl
          query string(Tatsuo)

	  * Bug fixes

	    - Close all file descriptors when running in daemon mode.
	      Otherwise we inherit sockets from apache when it's
	      started by pgpoolAdmin. This results in that port 80 is
	      occupied for example.  Patch provided by Akio
	      Ishida. Also add chdir("/"). This is always good for
	      daemon programs(Tatsuo)

	    - Allow MD5 authentication in raw mode as stated in docs(Tatsuo)

	    - Check transaction serialization failure error in
	      serializable mode and abort all nodes if so. Otherwise
	      we allow data inconsistency among DB nodes(Tatsuo).

	      See following scenario: (M:master, S:slave)

		  	M:S1:BEGIN;
			M:S2:BEGIN;
			S:S1:BEGIN;
			S:S2:BEGIN;
			M:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			M:S2:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			S:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			S:S2:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			M:S1:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1;
			S:S1:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1;
			M:S2:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1; <-- blocked
			S:S1:COMMIT;
			M:S1:COMMIT;
			M:S2:ERROR:  could not serialize access due to concurrent update
			S:S2:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1; <-- success in UPDATE and data becomes inconsistent!

		- avoid kind mismatch error caused by "SET TRANSACTION
		  ISOLATION LEVEL must be called before any query"(Tatsuo).

		   This could happen in following scenario:

	        M:S1:BEGIN;
            S:S1:BEGIN;
			M:S1:SELECT 1; <-- only sent to MASTER
			M:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			S:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			M: <-- error
			S: <-- ok since no previous SELECT is sent. kind mismatch error occurs!

		- Process status display has extra space on FreeeBSD(Jun Kuriyama)

		- Fix incorrect kind mismatch detection case. e.g: BEGIN;
		  BEGIN; (Tatsuo)

	    - If PostgreSQL sends lots of DEBUG message, sometimes pgpool
	      complains:
		  2008-11-08 22:41:53 ERROR: pid 23744: do_command: backend does not
		  return ReadyForQuery. This due to a wrong assumption for the
		  client/server protocol(Tatsuo)

		- Fix the case when sending an erronous query to abort
          transaction. It assumed that after sending an error query,
          always ReadyForQuery came right after that. If some
          debugging or logging verboseness is set, PostgreSQL might
          sends NOTICE before ReadyForQuery(Tatsuo)

		- Query cancelation now works. It never worked since pgpool-II
          was born(Tatsuo)

		- Fix online recovery to wait for failback done before
          allowing to accept connections from clients. It was supposed
          to work like this but actually was not since the day 0 when
          online recovery was born. Without the fix there could be
          potential data inconsistency among DB nodes(Tatsuo)

		- Fix pgpool-II crash after on line recovery. This happens
          after the failback process adds a recovered node which has
          no connection to the node(Tatsuo)

		- Fix pgpool-II errors when postgresql.conf is reloaded. This
          was caused by parameter status packet sent asynchronously
          from backend, which indicates the internal setting of
          backend has been changed(Tatsuo)

	  * Incompatible changes

		- Always fail over and restart all children. Before we do
		  restart only if master has not been changed. This is
		  wrong. If we have trouble with network cable or something,
		  TCP/IP stack keeps on retrying for long time and the only
		  way to prevent it is restarting process(Tatsuo)

		- "logdir" is no more used. Instead use
          "pid_file_name"(Tatsuo)

		- Default value for insert_lock is now true(Tatsuo)

          a node is detached(Yoshiyuki)
        - Add new directive "client_idle_limit" to specify the time out since
          the last command is arrived from a client(Tatsuo)
  
      * Replication
        - Always start a new transaction even if the query is not in
          an explicit transaction to enhance the reliabilty of
          replication(Yoshiyuki)
        - Enhance the performance of replication for write
          queries. Now the worst case is 1/2 compared with single DB
          node regardless the number of DB nodes. Previous release
          tends to degrade according to the numer of DB
          nodes(Yoshiyuki)
        - Add "online recovery" which allows to add a DB node and sync
          with other DB nodes without stopping the pgpool
          server(Yoshiyuki)
        - Abort a transaction if INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE reports
          different number of result rows(Yoshiyuki)

          x=# update t set a = a + 1;
          ERROR:  pgpool detected difference of the number of update tuples
          HINT:  check data consistency between master and other db node

        - If the results from DB nodes do not match, select the
          possible correct result by "decide by majority". Previous
          release always trust the result of the master DB
          node(Yoshiyuki)
        - Allow load balance in V2 frontend/backend protocol(Yoshiyuki)

      * Parallel query
        - Allow "partial replication" to enhance the performance of
          the parallel query(Yoshiharu)

      * Improve signal handling. (Yoshiyuki)
        - Occasionaly, zombie processes were remained. Or processes
          were unstable.
